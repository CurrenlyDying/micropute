# 🎤 MicRecorder

MicRecorder is a Linux service for continuous background audio recording from a microphone. It saves recordings in segmented WAV files and includes features like automatic restart on failure, disk space checking, and robust error handling.

## ✨ Features

  * ⚙️ Runs as a systemd service.
  * 🎙️ Records from the default or a preferred audio input device.
  * 💾 Saves audio in configurable WAV segments (e.g., 30-minute files).

## 📋 Prerequisites

  * 🐧 Linux system with systemd
  * 🐍 Python 3.7+
  * 🔑 Root privileges for installation and service management.
  * 🌐 `curl` (for the one-line installation method) or `git` (for manual installation).

## 🚀 Installation

### One-Line Install (using curl)

Ensure `curl` is installed (`sudo apt install curl` if not).

```bash
mkdir -p micropute && cd micropute && \
curl -sLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CurrenlyDying/micropute/main/install.sh && \
curl -sLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CurrenlyDying/micropute/main/mic_recorder.py && \
chmod +x install.sh && \
sudo bash install.sh
```

### Manual Installation (using git)

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/CurrenlyDying/micropute.git
    cd micropute
    ```

    *(The `chmod +x install.sh` command is usually not needed for files cloned via git that already have execute permissions, but can be run if necessary.)*

2.  Run the installation script as root:

    ```bash
    sudo bash install.sh
    ```

The script handles dependency installation (if `requirements.txt` is present and handled by `install.sh`), directory setup, virtual environment creation, and systemd service configuration.

## ▶️ Usage

Manage the service using `systemctl`:

  * **Start service:**
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start mic_recorder
    ```
  * **Stop service:**
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl stop mic_recorder
    ```
  * **Check service status:**
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status mic_recorder
    ```
  * **Enable auto-start on boot:**
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable mic_recorder
    ```
  * **Disable auto-start on boot** (installer do this):
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl disable mic_recorder
    ```
  * **Restart service** (e.g., after configuration changes):
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart mic_recorder
    ```

## 🎧 Recorded Files

Audio segments are saved in the `OUTPUT_DIR` (default: `/var/lib/mic_recorder/`) with filenames like `recording_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.wav`.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Key parameters can be modified at the beginning of the `/opt/mic_recorder/mic_recorder.py` script.

Editable parameters include:

  * `RATE`: Sample rate (default: `44100` Hz).
  * `CHANNELS`: Audio channels (1 for mono, 2 for stereo).
  * `OUTPUT_DIR`: Directory for recordings (default: `"/var/lib/mic_recorder/"`).
  * `SEGMENT_DURATION_SECONDS`: Duration of each audio segment (default: `1800`s / 30 minutes).
  * `CHUNK_DURATION_SECONDS`: Duration of in-memory recording chunks before writing to disk (default: `5`s).
  * `PREFERRED_DEVICE_NAME_SUBSTRING`: Substring of preferred device name (empty or `None` for auto-select based on `pyaudio`'s default).
  * `LOG_FILE`: Service log file path (default: `"/var/log/mic_recorder.log"`).
  * `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging verbosity (e.g., `logging.INFO`, `logging.DEBUG`).
  * `MIN_FREE_DISK_SPACE_MB`: Minimum free disk space (MB) required to continue recording.
  * And others related to retry logic and pauses (e.g., `RETRY_DELAY_SECONDS`, `MAX_RETRIES`).

**Important:** Restart the service after any configuration changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart mic_recorder
```

## 📜 Logging

  * **Service Logs:** `/var/log/mic_recorder.log` (or as configured by `LOG_FILE`).
      * View live logs:
        ```bash
        sudo tail -f /var/log/mic_recorder.log
        ```
  * **Installation/Uninstallation Logs:** `/tmp/mic_recorder_install.log` and `/tmp/mic_recorder_uninstall.log` (generated by the `install.sh` and `uninstall.sh` scripts for troobleshooting).

## 🗑️ Uninstallation

1.  Navigate to the directory where `uninstall.sh` is located.
2.  Run the uninstallation script as root:
    ```bash
    sudo bash uninstall.sh
    ```

The script will stop the service, remove installed files, and optionally prompt whether to remove recorded audio and service logs.

Anyway...
